# W4A16 with NVFP4 activation prefill

This experimental SM120 path reuses ModelOpt NVFP4 W4A16 weights for
NVFP4 activation GEMMs during prefill. Activation quantization changes model
outputs and requires model quality validation before deployment. The default
remains W4A16.

Set `B12X_W4A16_A4_PREFILL=1` before preparing weights and execution plans to
enable this capability. Preparation requires finite,
positive input and intermediate calibration scales; absent scales and a pair
of all-one placeholder scales retain W4A16. The shared input global scale is
the minimum across experts. Intermediate scales remain per expert. Ordinary
A4 weight preparation retains its per-expert scales.

Supported weights use packed ModelOpt NVFP4 with ordinary or compressed
NVFP4-CSF block scales, BF16 input/output, SiLU gating, hidden size divisible
by 256, and intermediate size divisible by 64. FC1 masks the unused half of
a final 128-channel intermediate tile and reads gate/up scale halves from
their original compressed slabs. A positive `swiglu_limit` uses
the W4A16 activation contract: clamp the BF16 GEMM gate above the limit and the
up input to the symmetric interval, round SiLU and up to BF16, multiply, then
round the intermediate to BF16 before quantization. Expert maps, input router
weighting, activation-amax collection, and unsupported layouts retain W4A16.

The execution binding accepts `a4_prefill`:

- `True` selects prepared A4 launches.
- `False` or `None` selects W4A16.

The caller selects precision from request semantics: prefill may use A4;
decode and speculative verification use A16. Token count does not select
hybrid precision, and `ActivationSpec.a16_max_tokens` does not override an
explicit `a4_prefill=True`. Each call must fit its prepared capacity and
caller-owned scratch buffers. When an exact decode variant lacks the padded
A4 workspace, a composite plan reuses a larger fitting prepared variant in
the same scratch arena. A plan with no fitting A4 variant retains W4A16.

For stage-readable NVFP4-CSF storage, the A4 GEMMs reconstruct their scale
tiles in shared memory from the same compressed bytes used by A16. The
selected stage-decoding launches bypass full expansion into global scratch.
Other consumers can still require that scratch; selecting an in-kernel
decoder does not remove the shared allocation from the prepared owner.

Plans also prepare dense A4 scale consumers when their capacity exceeds
`B12X_W4A16_CSF_STAGE_MAX_TOKENS` (default `1536`). A call with more live rows
than this limit selects those consumers only with `scales_expanded=True`.
The caller must have expanded this layer's scales and ordered that expansion
before the call, after the previous use of shared scale scratch. Calls at or
below the limit, and calls without ready expanded scales, retain stage
decoding. This size policy selects the scale consumer; precision remains
controlled by `a4_prefill`.

`uses_expanded_nvfp4_scales(plan, num_tokens=..., a4_prefill=...,
route_ids_dtype=..., scales_expanded=...)` reports whether the selected call reads expanded
NVFP4-CSF scales. It requires a prepared execution plan and performs no GPU
work. Serving integrations can omit scale prefetch when every following-layer
span uses a compressed-scale reader. To decide whether to prefetch, query
the following layer's spans with prospective `scales_expanded=True`; pass
True to the execution binding only after arranging the corresponding stream
ordering. CUDA graph calls without external scale preparation use the default
False and retain stage decoding. Outstanding writes to shared scale scratch
still require synchronization before reusing that scratch.

`B12X_W4A16_A4_PREFILL_TERMS=1` uses one NVFP4 activation plane. A value of `2`
adds an independently quantized residual plane. `B12X_W4A16_A4_PREFILL_WARPS`
accepts `8` (default) or `16`. These controls and the capability flag are immutable
execution-plan inputs and are part of tuning query schema 26. Changing the
environment requires preparing another execution plan. Kernel compilation
retains device-owned callables; replay performs no compilation or tensor
allocation. A4 always applies router weights in the FP32 final sum. Set
`B12X_W4A16_FP32_TOPK_WEIGHTS=1` before importing B12X when comparing with an
A16 baseline that also uses FP32 router weighting.

Run the synthetic quantization-contract and changed-input graph checks on an
SM120 GPU from the FlashInfer repository:

```sh
PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PWD/flashinfer/experimental/b12x/_compat" \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/experimental/b12x/moe/test_w4a16_a4_prefill.py -v
```

The two-device ownership check requires two visible SM120 GPUs. These checks
verify the specified lossy arithmetic and replay behavior; they do not measure
model accuracy or serving throughput.
